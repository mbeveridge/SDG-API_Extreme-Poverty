## Data import

Connect to data at https://apihighways.org/data-sets/6a6de0b8-e544-495a-93ab-e8bc3c59fb20

API code copied from the apihighways page for this dataset (and previously included ` engine.path="/Users/markbeveridge/anaconda3/bin/python"` in the header, to make it work for a single chunk) :

```{python}
import http.client

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("api.apihighways.org")

conn.request("GET", "/query?sql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%206a6de0b8-e544-495a-93ab-e8bc3c59fb20")

res = conn.getresponse()
data = res.read()

# print(data.decode("utf-8"))                     # Don't need/want to print all the data

# ----------
# Currently unable to share state across Python chunks [https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/222207188-Multiple-Python-chunks-in-RStudio-R-Markdown], "we're hoping to make some improvements for this in RStudio 1.2". Which means a 2nd chunk wouldn't be able to use the `data` from this one. (It does work if all the code is in a single chunk)
# ----------
# To overcome that, installed **reticulate** package, which should make it possible to share ...but doesn't work for me, below, when I try to call `data` in either another python chunk, or an r chunk. (I tried both running and knitting). cf. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49503195/reticulate-running-python-chunks-in-rmarkdown] ; [https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1440] ; [https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate/pull/107]
```

```{python}
# "If you add this code it might be useful in parsing the JSON into a Python dictionary" :
import json
j = json.loads(data)

print(j['data'][0])
```
